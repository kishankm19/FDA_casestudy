    <h1>Food Transport Modernization with Blockchain</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The way we track food transport (especially with containers) is outdated. We rely heavily on paper records.</li> 
            <li>Paper is easily lost, damaged, and hard to search through. Think of trying to quickly figure out where a contaminated food shipment came from!</li> 
            <li>Auditors also have to waste a lot of time physically going to sites and looking through stacks of paper to confirm safety standards.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Proposed Solution: Blockchain</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Blockchain is like a digital record book that is both secure and virtually impossible to alter. Think of it as a super-powered spreadsheet that many people can update, but no one person controls.</li>
            <li>We can use blockchain to create a system where everyone involved in food transport (loading facilities, washing stations, etc.) can easily update a digital record of what and when a container was used.</li>
            <li>This creates a permanent, easily searchable, verifiable history of the container!</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Benefits with Blockchain</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food Safety:</strong> In case of an illness outbreak, we could super quickly trace where the contamination happened.</li>
            <li><strong>Easier Audits:</strong> Government agencies and certification groups can instantly generate reports instead of spending days hunting paper records.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust:</strong> The whole food chain becomes more transparent, making it easier to confirm quality and origins.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>This Project's Goal</h2>
        <p>This proposal isn't about building the whole system right away. Instead, the focus is on proving this idea works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choose the Right Tech:</strong> Figure out the best type of blockchain to use and how to design the digital record system.</li>
            <li><strong>Build a Basic App:</strong> Whip up a simple mobile app for truck drivers and facilities to update the digital records.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-World Test:</strong> Put this system to use with a small number of trailers. Track how well it improves food safety and the certification process.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>This project is about using cutting-edge technology to make our food safer and the whole supply chain more efficient. Success means a big step forward for public health and the food industry.</p>
